## About

Hey there! I'm Tony, a cybersecurity professional with a passion for problem-solving and connecting with others. Whether I'm collaborating on a project or mentoring someone new to the field, I love working with like-minded individuals to achieve common goals. When I'm not delving into the latest security trends or brushing up on my coding skills, you can usually find me hiking, practicing martial arts, or indulging in a good cup of coffee. I'm excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and explore new opportunities together.
